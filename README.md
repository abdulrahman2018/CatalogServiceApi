# Catalog Service

## Overview

The Catalog Service is a backend service designed to manage the list of items available for purchase. It handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for catalog items and interacts with a MySQL database dedicated to storing and managing these items.

## Responsibilities

- **Manage Catalog Items**: The service provides endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete catalog items.
- **Item Management**: Users can add new items, view existing items, update item details, and remove items from the catalog.
- **Database Integration**: It connects to a MySQL database to store and manage item information.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8
- **Database**: MySQL

## Database Schema

The Catalog Service uses a MySQL database to manage the catalog items. The database schema includes the following:

- **CatalogItem**: A table to store details about each catalog item.

### Example Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE CatalogItem (
    Id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Description TEXT,
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    Quantity INT NOT NULL
);
```

## API Endpoints

The Catalog Service exposes several API endpoints for interacting with catalog items:

- **GET /api/catalog**: Retrieves a list of all catalog items.
- **GET /api/catalog/{id}**: Retrieves a specific catalog item by its ID.
- **POST /api/catalog**: Creates a new catalog item.
- **PUT /api/catalog/{id}**: Updates an existing catalog item.
- **DELETE /api/catalog/{id}**: Deletes a catalog item by its ID.
